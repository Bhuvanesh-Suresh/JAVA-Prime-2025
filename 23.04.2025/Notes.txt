Hashmap:
    Replace the array as it has some disadvantages.
    Time complexity of array to add or remove a element is O(N).
    Reduction.(Cannot construct orginal input from the reduced output).
    MAP:
        Key value.
        Associative array.(An array with non numeric index values).
    The key value will be hashed and stored in the hash table.If the key is same then the value is
    stored as a linked list , when the linked list exceds 8 a tree is created.
    Index in Hashmap is called buckets.
